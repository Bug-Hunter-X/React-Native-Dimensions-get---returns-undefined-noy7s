This error occurs when using the `Dimensions` API in React Native to get screen dimensions. The problem is that `Dimensions.get('window')` or `Dimensions.get('screen')` might return `undefined` if called too early in the component's lifecycle before the layout is measured. This will often lead to unexpected behavior or app crashes, especially when used to calculate sizes or positions of UI elements.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
const { width, height } = Dimensions.get('window');
// ...use width and height...
```
